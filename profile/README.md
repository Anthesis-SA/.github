# Anthesis-SA 

Welcome to the Anthesis-SA GitHub page. [Anthesis South Africa](https://www.anthesisgroup.com/za/) helps organisations reimagine progress. 
We work towards solutions for some of the world's most pressing challenges by fostering environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and economic resilience for our clients. 
Our [solutions](https://www.anthesisgroup.com/za/solutions/) cover carbon project development, sustainability reporting, support for climate and net-zero transitions, and transformation of products and business models for supply chains and responsible sourcing. 

We use GitHub to manage our code-dependent workstreams within specific projects that rely on robust and transparent quantitative approaches. 
These include but are not limited to using remote-sensing data products to inform on land-use change, and the development of soil carbon models for application in agricultural systems.
